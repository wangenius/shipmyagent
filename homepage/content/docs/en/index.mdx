# What is ShipMyAgent?

ShipMyAgent is a tool that allows you to quickly transform any code repository into an **Agentic Workspace**.

With simple configuration, you can let an AI maintainer:

- 🛡️ **Auto Code Review**: Automatically check code quality before PR submission.
- 🧹 **Clear Technical Debt**: Scan TODOs in the codebase and automatically generate fix proposals.
- 🤖 **Automate Routine Tasks**: Run maintenance tasks via Cron Jobs.
- 💬 **Natural Language Interaction**: Chat directly with your codebase via tools like Telegram.

## Core Features

- **Local First**: Runs directly in your local codebase, no need to upload code to third-party servers.
- **Simple Configuration**: Define agent persona via `Agent.md`, configure permissions and tools via `ship.json`.
- **Model Agnostic**: Supports Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, etc., and supports switching.
- **Task Scheduling**: Built-in Cron scheduler to execute complex maintenance tasks periodically.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designed primarily to assist developers, all high-risk operations require human approval.

## How it Works?

ShipMyAgent runs a lightweight Agent Server in your project. It connects the LLM and your codebase through a built-in toolset.

1. **Init**: Run `shipmyagent init` in the project root to generate config files.
2. **Config**: Edit `Agent.md` to tell the AI what it should do.
3. **Start**: `shipmyagent .` runs in foreground (current terminal); `shipmyagent start [path]` runs in background (daemon).
