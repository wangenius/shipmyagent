# Configuration

## ship.json

`ship.json` is the main configuration file for ShipMyAgent, controlling the Agent's capabilities and behavior boundaries.

### Complete Example

```json
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}", // Supports environment variables
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "maxTokens": 4096
  },
  "permissions": {
    "read_repo": true,
    "write_repo": {
      "paths": ["src/**", "docs/**"], // Restrict write paths
      "requiresApproval": true // Whether approval is required before writing
    },
    "exec_shell": {
      "allow": ["npm test", "npm run lint"], // Whitelist of allowed commands
      "requiresApproval": true
    }
  },
  "integrations": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}",
      "chatId": "${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}" // Only allow interaction from specific users/groups
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Explanation

#### `llm` (Language Model)

- **provider**: `anthropic`, `openai`, `deepseek`, `custom`.
- **model**: Specific model name.
- **apiKey**: Recommended to use `${ENV_VAR}` to reference environment variables to avoid leakage.

#### `permissions`

ShipMyAgent follows the "Least Privilege Principle".

- **read_repo**: Whether to allow reading repository files.
- **write_repo**:
  - **paths**: Array of Glob patterns, restricting the Agent to modify only specific directories.
  - **requiresApproval**: Strongly recommended to set to `true`. If set to `false`, the Agent can modify files autonomously (use with caution).
- **exec_shell**:
  - **allow**: List or patterns of allowed commands.
  - **requiresApproval**: Whether confirmation is required before execution.

## Agent.md

`Agent.md` is the carrier of the System Prompt. It determines the Agent's "Personality" and "Professional Ethics".

### Writing Tips

#### 1. Define Role

```markdown
# Agent Role

You are a senior frontend architect, focusing on React performance optimization.
```

#### 2. Set Goals

```markdown
## Goals

- Review all new component code submissions.
- Ensure no unnecessary re-renders are introduced.
- Keep component code concise and reusable.
```

#### 3. Set Constraints

```markdown
## Constraints

- Never modify dependency versions in `package.json`.
- All CSS styles must use Tailwind class names, inline styles are prohibited.
- You must explain the reason before modifying code.
```

#### 4. Provide Context

You can write important project specifications and code style guides directly in `Agent.md`, and the Agent will bear these rules in mind during every conversation.
