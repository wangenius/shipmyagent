---

# Quick Start

## 1. Installation

First, install the `shipmyagent` command-line tool globally. Ensure your Node.js version is >= 18.

```bash
npm install -g shipmyagent
```

## 2. Initialize Project

Go to the root directory of the code repository you want to deploy the Agent to, and run the initialization command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
shipmyagent init
```

The interactive guide will ask for the following information:

- **Agent Name**: Give your Agent a name (defaults to current directory name).
- **LLM Model**: Select the model you want to use. Supports Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, GPT-4o, DeepSeek Chat, etc. Recommended `Claude Sonnet 4` for the best experience.
- **Chat Adapters (Multi-select)**: Optionally enable Telegram / Feishu / QQ. **Only selected adapters will be written to `ship.json.services.chat.adapters`**.
- **QQ Sandbox** (only when QQ is selected): Whether to use sandbox environment for testing.
- **Skills Installation** (Optional): Optionally install recommended skill plugins, such as Vercel Best Practices, Web Design Guidelines, Browser Automation, etc.

After initialization, it will create in your directory:

```
your-project/
├── Agent.md           # Agent system prompt
├── .env.example       # Environment variables template (recommended)
├── .env               # Local environment variables (do not commit)

    │   ├── ship.schema.json
    │   └── mcp.schema.json
    └── .debug/        # Debug information
```

> **Tip**: The Profile memory system saves user preferences, MCP configuration supports Model Context Protocol, and Schema files provide IDE auto-completion.

## 3. Configure LLM

Fill in your API Key via `.env` (recommended) or directly in `ship.json` (be careful not to commit secrets).

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "sk-ant-..." // Replace with your API Key
  }
}
```

## 4. Start Agent

After configuration, start the Agent Server:

```bash
shipmyagent .
# `shipmyagent .`: foreground (current terminal)
# `shipmyagent start [path]`: background (daemon)
```

You will see output similar to the following:

```
🚀 Starting ShipMyAgent: /path/to/project
=== ShipMyAgent Started ===
...
Task Scheduler Initialized
(Optional) An adapter is enabled (e.g. Telegram)
```

Now, your Agent is online and starting to run according to the configuration!
If Telegram is enabled, you can send a message directly to the Bot: "Help me check the recently modified code".
