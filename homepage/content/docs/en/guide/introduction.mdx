# Core Concepts

Before using ShipMyAgent, understanding these core concepts will help you better configure and use your Agent.

## 1. Agent Runtime

Agent Runtime is the core engine of ShipMyAgent. It is responsible for:

- Loading the System Prompt from `Agent.md`.
- Managing the LLM's context window.
- Distributing and executing Tool Calls.
- Handling file system read/write permissions.

## 2. Configuration Files

ShipMyAgent uses two main files to define the Agent's behavior:

### Agent.md

This is the Agent's "Brain". Here you use natural language to define the Agent's role, goals, constraints, and behavior guidelines.
For example, you can tell the Agent: "You are a strict code reviewer, focusing specifically on TypeScript type safety."

### ship.json

This is the Agent's "Body". It defines the Agent's capability boundaries, including:

- **LLM Configuration**: Which model to use (Claude, GPT, DeepSeek).
- **Permissions**: Which files the Agent can read, whether it allows writing, and whether it allows executing Shell commands.
- **Services**: Whether to enable external interfaces like Telegram Bot.

## 3. Tasks

Tasks are the automation units of ShipMyAgent. They are stored under `.ship/task/` (one folder per task).
Each task definition is a Markdown file (`task.md`) containing:

- **Metadata (frontmatter)**: title, cron schedule expression, status, and a target `chatKey` to notify.
- **Task Description**: A natural language description telling the Agent what operation to perform periodically.

For example, you can create a task: "Scan TODOs in the codebase every morning at 9 AM and generate a report."
