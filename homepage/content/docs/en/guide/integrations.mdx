# Integrations

ShipMyAgent supports integration with instant messaging software, allowing you to stay in touch with your Agent anytime, anywhere.

## Telegram Bot

Currently, the most complete integration is Telegram. Through Telegram, you can:

- Ask the Agent questions at any time.
- Receive notifications of task execution results.
- Approve sensitive operations (such as file writing).

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Bot**
   - Search for `@BotFather` in Telegram.
   - Send the `/newbot` command.
   - Set the Bot's name and username as prompted.
   - Get the **HTTP API Token**.

2. **Get Chat ID**
   - Search for `@userinfobot` (or similar ID fetching Bot) in Telegram.
   - Send any message to get your numeric User ID.
   - Alternatively, if you want to use it in a group, pull the Bot into the group and get the group ID.

3. **Configure ship.json**

Edit the `integrations.telegram` section of `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz",
      "chatId": "12345678" // Your User ID
    }
  }
}
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Configuring `chatId` is very important. If not configured, anyone who knows your Bot username can interact with your local codebase! After configuring a specific `chatId`, the Bot will only respond to messages from that ID.

4. **Restart Service**
   Run `shipmyagent start` to restart the service.

### Usage

- **Direct Chat**: Send a message to chat with the Agent.
- **Commands**:
  - `/status`: View Agent current status.
  - `/tasks`: View scheduled tasks.

## Feishu/Lark Bot

Feishu (Lark) is a popular enterprise collaboration platform. You can integrate ShipMyAgent with Feishu to interact with your Agent.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Feishu Bot**
   - Visit [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/document/develop-an-echo-bot/introduction)
   - Follow the guide to create a new bot application
   - Get your **App ID** and **App Secret**

2. **Configure ship.json**

Edit the `integrations.feishu` section of `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "feishu": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "cli_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "appSecret": "your_app_secret_here"
    }
  }
}
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Keep your App Secret secure. Never commit it to version control. Consider using environment variables.

3. **Restart Service**
   Run `shipmyagent start` to restart the service.

### Usage

- **Direct Chat**: Send a message to chat with the Agent in Feishu.
- **Group Chat**: Add the bot to a group to enable team collaboration.

## QQ Bot

QQ is one of the most popular instant messaging platforms in China. You can integrate ShipMyAgent with QQ Bot to interact with your Agent.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create QQ Bot**
   - Visit [QQ Open Platform](https://bot.q.qq.com/wiki)
   - Follow the guide to create a new bot application
   - Get your **App ID** and **App Secret**

2. **Configure ship.json**

Edit the `integrations.qq` section of `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "qq": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "your_app_id_here",
      "appSecret": "your_app_secret_here"
    }
  }
}
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Keep your App Secret secure. Never commit it to version control. Consider using environment variables.

3. **Restart Service**
   Run `shipmyagent start` to restart the service.

### Usage

- **Direct Chat**: Send a message to chat with the Agent in QQ.
- **Group Chat**: Add the bot to a group to enable team collaboration.
- **Debug (raw events)**: If you want to see what fields QQ actually sends (e.g. sender nickname/username), enable raw gateway event capture:
  - `SHIP_QQ_CAPTURE_EVENTS=dispatch` (business events only) or `SHIP_QQ_CAPTURE_EVENTS=all` (includes heartbeats/handshakes)
  - Optional: `SHIP_QQ_CAPTURE_DIR=...` (defaults to `<projectRoot>/.ship/.debug/qq-events/`)
