# Integrations

ShipMyAgent supports integration with instant messaging software, allowing you to stay in touch with your Agent anytime, anywhere.

## Telegram Bot

Currently, the most complete integration is Telegram. Through Telegram, you can:

- Ask the Agent questions at any time.
- Receive notifications of task execution results.
- Approve sensitive operations (such as file writing).

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Bot**
   - Search for `@BotFather` in Telegram.
   - Send the `/newbot` command.
   - Set the Bot's name and username as prompted.
   - Get the **HTTP API Token**.

2. **Get Chat ID**
   - Search for `@userinfobot` (or similar ID fetching Bot) in Telegram.
   - Send any message to get your numeric User ID.
   - Alternatively, if you want to use it in a group, pull the Bot into the group and get the group ID.

3. **Configure ship.json**

Edit the `integrations.telegram` section of `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz",
      "chatId": "12345678" // Your User ID
    }
  }
}
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Configuring `chatId` is very important. If not configured, anyone who knows your Bot username can interact with your local codebase! After configuring a specific `chatId`, the Bot will only respond to messages from that ID.

4. **Restart Service**
   Run `shipmyagent start` to restart the service.

### Usage

- **Direct Chat**: Send a message to chat with the Agent.
- **Commands**:
  - `/status`: View Agent current status.
  - `/tasks`: View scheduled tasks.

## Upcoming Integrations

- **Discord**: In development.
- **Slack**: Planned.
- **Feishu/Lark**: Planned.
