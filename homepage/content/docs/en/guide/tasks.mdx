# Automated Tasks

ShipMyAgent has a built-in lightweight task scheduler that allows you to define periodic tasks using Markdown files.

## Task Location

All task files are stored in the `.ship/tasks/` directory of the project.

## Creating a Task

Create a new Markdown file, for example `.ship/tasks/daily-report.md`:

```markdown
---
id: daily-report
name: Daily Progress Report
cron: "0 18 * * *" # Execute daily at 6 PM
notify: telegram # Send execution results to Telegram
---

Please scan all files modified today (past 24 hours).
Summarize the main content of these modifications and generate a brief report.
If distinct Bugs or code style issues are found, please highlight them.
```

### Frontmatter Properties

- **id**: Unique task identifier.
- **name**: Task display name.
- **cron**: Standard Cron expression.
  - `* * * * *` (Minute Hour Day Month Week)
  - Example: `"0 9 * * 1-5"` (Monday to Friday at 9 AM)
- **notify**: Channel to notify after task completion (currently supports `telegram` or `console`).

### Task Content

The Markdown body part is the Prompt passed to the Agent.
When Cron triggers, the system will create a new conversation thread, send the Prompt here to the Agent, and send the Agent's response to you via the channel specified in `notify`.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Automated Code Review

Periodically scan recent code changes for review.

```markdown
---
cron: "0 */4 * * *" # Every 4 hours
---

Check code modified in the past 4 hours, looking for potential memory leaks or unhandled Promises.
```

### 2. Clean TODOs

```markdown
---
cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9 AM
---

Globally search for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the code.
Organize a list and evaluate the priority of these TODOs based on context.
```

### 3. Generate Changelog

```markdown
---
cron: "0 20 * * 5" # Every Friday at 8 PM
---

Read the git commit log for the past week.
Generate a well-formatted Changelog for use in the weekly report.
```
