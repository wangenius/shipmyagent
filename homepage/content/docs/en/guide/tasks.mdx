# Automated Tasks

ShipMyAgent has a built-in lightweight task scheduler that allows you to define periodic tasks using Markdown files.

## Task Location

Tasks are stored under `.ship/task/` (note: `task`, not `tasks`), one folder per task.

## Creating a Task

Create a task definition at `.ship/task/daily-report/task.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Daily Progress Report
cron: "0 18 * * *" # Execute daily at 6 PM
description: Summarize recent changes and highlight issues
chatKey: telegram-chat-123456789
status: enabled
---

Please scan all files modified today (past 24 hours).
Summarize the main content of these modifications and generate a brief report.
If distinct Bugs or code style issues are found, please highlight them.
```

### Frontmatter Properties

- **title**: Task display name.
- **cron**: `node-cron` compatible 5-field expression.
  - `* * * * *` (Minute Hour Day Month Week)
  - Example: `"0 9 * * 1-5"` (Monday to Friday at 9 AM)
- **description**: One-line purpose for lists and audits.
- **chatKey**: Where the result is delivered after each run (for example `telegram-chat-...`).
- **status**: `enabled | paused | disabled`.
  - Use `cron: "@manual"` for manual-only tasks.

### Task Content

The Markdown body part is the Prompt passed to the Agent.
When Cron triggers, the system will create a new run with a clean history, send the Prompt here to the Agent, write audit artifacts to the run folder, and send a summary message to `chatKey`.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Automated Code Review

Periodically scan recent code changes for review.

```markdown
---
cron: "0 */4 * * *" # Every 4 hours
---

Check code modified in the past 4 hours, looking for potential memory leaks or unhandled Promises.
```

### 2. Clean TODOs

```markdown
---
cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9 AM
---

Globally search for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the code.
Organize a list and evaluate the priority of these TODOs based on context.
```

### 3. Generate Changelog

```markdown
---
cron: "0 20 * * 5" # Every Friday at 8 PM
---

Read the git commit log for the past week.
Generate a well-formatted Changelog for use in the weekly report.
```
