# Skills (Claude Code Compatible)

ShipMyAgent supports **Claude Code-compatible skills**. This page explains how skills are laid out on disk, how they’re discovered, how they’re exposed to the Agent as tools, and an important current behavior difference around the system prompt.

## Directory layout

By default ShipMyAgent scans 2 skill root types:

- Project: `<project>/.ship/skills`
- Home (global): `~/.ship/skills`

You can add extra roots via `ship.json.skills.paths`. By default `sma init` writes `skills.paths: [".claude/skills"]` and creates `./.claude/skills/` to stay compatible with common community layouts.

Project skills layout example (recommended under `.ship/skills`):

```text
.ship/skills/
  <skill-id>/
    SKILL.md
    (optional) scripts/
    (optional) assets/
```

- `<skill-id>`: the folder name (used as `id`).
- `SKILL.md` is required; otherwise the folder won’t be treated as a skill.

## SKILL.md metadata (front matter)

During discovery, ShipMyAgent reads YAML front matter from `SKILL.md`:

- `name`: display name (defaults to `<skill-id>`)
- `description`: human-readable description
- `allowed-tools` (or `allowedTools` / `allowed_tools`): “allowed tools” hint

> `allowed-tools` is enforced **after a skill is loaded** in the current run: ShipMyAgent limits the model’s callable tools to the union of the loaded skill(s)’ `allowed-tools` (with `chat_send` always allowed so the agent can reply).

## Skill roots configuration

Configure skill roots in `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": [".claude/skills", ".my/skills"],
    "allowExternalPaths": false
  }
}
```

Key rules:

- `paths` supports relative paths (resolved from project root), absolute paths, and `~` expansion (for extra roots).
- If a root’s basename is not `skills` and it contains a `skills/` child directory, ShipMyAgent will prefer scanning `<root>/skills/` (compatibility with layouts like `.claude/skills`).
- By default `allowExternalPaths=false`, so ShipMyAgent scans **project + home** roots, but will skip any extra configured roots outside the project unless you set `allowExternalPaths=true`.

## How the Agent uses skills

Skills are exposed to the model via two built-in tools:

- `skills_list`: list available skills (`id/name/description/allowedTools`)
- `skills_load`: find a skill by `id`/`name` and return the full `SKILL.md`

Typical flow:

1. Call `skills_list` to discover what exists
2. Call `skills_load` to read the full instructions
3. Follow the `SKILL.md` steps using other tools as needed (tool access may be restricted by `allowed-tools`)

## Skills section in the system prompt

`shipmyagent start` and the chat adapters now include a “skills summary section” in the final system prompt (the composed `Agent.md`). This helps the model know from the start:

- which skill roots exist
- to use `skills_list` / `skills_load` to discover and load skills
- which skills were found (up to 40 listed)

## CLI (optional)

ShipMyAgent provides a thin wrapper around `npx skills`:

- Find: `sma skill find react|nextjs|design`
- Add: `sma skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices` (syncs into `~/.ship/skills`)
- List discoverable skills for a project: `sma skill list`
