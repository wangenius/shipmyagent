# Skills (Claude Code Compatible)

ShipMyAgent supports **Claude Code-compatible skills**. This page explains how skills are laid out on disk, how they’re discovered, how they’re exposed to the Agent as tools, and an important current behavior difference around the system prompt.

## Directory layout

Default skills root is `.claude/skills` under your project root:

```text
.claude/skills/
  <skill-id>/
    SKILL.md
    (optional) scripts/
    (optional) assets/
```

- `<skill-id>`: the folder name (used as `id`).
- `SKILL.md` is required; otherwise the folder won’t be treated as a skill.

## SKILL.md metadata (front matter)

During discovery, ShipMyAgent reads YAML front matter from `SKILL.md`:

- `name`: display name (defaults to `<skill-id>`)
- `description`: human-readable description
- `allowed-tools` (or `allowedTools` / `allowed_tools`): “allowed tools” hint

> `allowed-tools` is currently metadata/prompt guidance only; it is not enforced as a hard runtime restriction.

## Skill roots configuration

Configure skill roots in `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": [".claude/skills", ".my/skills"],
    "allowExternalPaths": false
  }
}
```

Key rules:

- `paths` supports relative paths (resolved from project root), absolute paths, and `~` expansion.
- If a root’s basename is not `skills` and it contains a `skills/` child directory, ShipMyAgent will prefer scanning `<root>/skills/` (compatibility with layouts like `.claude/skills`).
- By default `allowExternalPaths=false`, so only paths under the project root are scanned.

## How the Agent uses skills

Skills are exposed to the model via two built-in tools:

- `skills_list`: list available skills (`id/name/description/allowedTools`)
- `skills_load`: find a skill by `id`/`name` and return the full `SKILL.md`

Typical flow:

1. Call `skills_list` to discover what exists
2. Call `skills_load` to read the full instructions
3. Follow the `SKILL.md` steps using other tools as needed

## Skills section in the system prompt

`shipmyagent start` and the chat adapters now include a “skills summary section” in the final system prompt (the composed `Agent.md`). This helps the model know from the start:

- which skill roots exist
- to use `skills_list` / `skills_load` to discover and load skills
- which skills were found (up to 40 listed)
