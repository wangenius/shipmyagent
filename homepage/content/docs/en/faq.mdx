## General Questions

### What is ShipMyAgent?

ShipMyAgent is an AI-powered development assistant that runs locally in your codebase. It helps automate code reviews, maintenance tasks, and provides natural language interaction with your repository.

### How is it different from GitHub Copilot?

| Feature | ShipMyAgent | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Autonomous agent | Code completion |
| **Operation** | Runs scheduled tasks | In-editor suggestions |
| **Control** | Full configuration | Limited control |
| **Interaction** | Natural language | Code completion |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted | Cloud service |

### Do I need to upload my code?

**No.** ShipMyAgent runs entirely locally. Your code never leaves your machine except when sent to the LLM API for processing.

### What LLM providers are supported?

- ✅ Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus)
- ✅ OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo)
- ✅ DeepSeek
- ✅ Any OpenAI-compatible API

### What are the system requirements?

- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Node.js**: >= 18.0.0
- **Memory**: 512MB minimum, 1GB recommended
- **Disk**: 100MB for installation

### Is ShipMyAgent free?

Yes! ShipMyAgent is open-source and free to use. You only pay for the LLM API calls you make to your chosen provider.

### Can I use it offline?

Partial. The agent needs internet access to communicate with LLM APIs, but all file operations and task scheduling work offline.

## Configuration Questions

### How do I change the LLM model?

Edit `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"
  }
}
```

### Can I use multiple LLMs?

Yes, configure fallback models:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "primary": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    },
    "fallback": [
      {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### How do I set environment variables?

**Option 1: Shell profile** (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="123456:..."
```

**Option 2: .env file**:
```bash
# Create .env in project root
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:...
```

**Option 3: Direct in ship.json** (not recommended):
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "apiKey": "sk-ant-..."  // ⚠️ Don't commit this!
  }
}
```

## Service Questions

### Do I need to use Telegram?

No. Telegram is optional. You can use ShipMyAgent entirely via CLI without any services.

### How do I set up Telegram Bot?

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
3. Copy the HTTP API token
4. Get your chat ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
5. Add to `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}",
      "chatId": "12345678"
    }
  }
}
```

## Billing & Costs

### How much does it cost?

ShipMyAgent is **free**. You only pay for LLM API usage.

**Estimated LLM costs** (per 1M tokens):
- Claude 3.5 Haiku: ~$0.25 input / $1.25 output
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$3 input / $15 output
- GPT-4o: ~$2.50 input / $10 output

**Typical monthly usage**:
- Light usage: $5-20/month
- Medium usage: $20-50/month
- Heavy usage: $50-200/month

### How can I reduce costs?

1. **Use faster models**: Haiku instead of Sonnet
2. **Optimize prompts**: Keep `Agent.md` concise
3. **Limit task frequency**: Don't run tasks too often
4. **Use caching**: Enable response caching
5. **Set token limits**: Configure `maxTokens`

### Do I need a credit card?

You'll need a payment method with your LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.). ShipMyAgent itself doesn't charge anything.

### Is there a free tier?

Most LLM providers offer free tiers:
- Anthropic: Free credits for new accounts
- OpenAI: Free tier available
- DeepSeek: Very low cost alternatives
