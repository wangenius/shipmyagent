# Telegram integration

Use Telegram to chat with ShipMyAgent (DM or group mention) and receive approval prompts/results.

## Setup

### 1) Create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and find `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Follow the prompts
4. Copy the **HTTP API Token**

### 2) Configure your project

Add the token to your project `.env` (same directory as `ship.json`):

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:abc...
```

Enable Telegram in `ship.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3) Start ShipMyAgent

```bash
shipmyagent start
```

In logs you should see:

- `Starting Telegram Bot...`
- `Bot username: @...`
- `Telegram Bot started`

## How to use

### Direct message (DM)

Send `/start` (or any message) to your bot.

### Group / supergroup

- Add the bot to the group
- Talk to it by mentioning: `@your_bot ...`
- After you mention (or reply to the bot), you can send follow-up messages for a short time without mentioning again.

Notes:
- If your group uses **Topics**, replies are sent back to the same topic.
- In groups, ShipMyAgent may restrict who can talk to the bot (e.g. initiator/admin), depending on the runtime’s policy.

## Troubleshooting

- **No response at all**: confirm the process is running and check `.ship/logs/integration/telegram.log`.
- **Bot doesn’t receive group messages**: in BotFather run `/setprivacy` and set it to `Disable`, then make sure you’re mentioning the bot in the group.
- **Polling doesn’t work**: if you previously set a webhook, polling (`getUpdates`) will conflict. ShipMyAgent clears webhook on startup; check logs for webhook-related errors.
- **Bot can’t speak in the group**: check group permissions (the bot may be muted / not allowed to send messages).
