# Getting Started

Get ShipMyAgent up and running in minutes. This guide covers everything from installation to your first autonomous agent.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 installed
- **A code repository** (Git initialized)
- **An LLM API key** (Anthropic, OpenAI, or compatible)
- **Basic terminal knowledge**

:::info
Don't have an LLM API key? Get free credits from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
:::

## Installation

### Option 1: Global Install (Recommended)

Install ShipMyAgent globally for use in any project:

```bash
npm install -g shipmyagent
```

Verify installation:

```bash
shipmyagent --version
```

### Option 2: Using npx (No Install)

Use ShipMyAgent without installing:

```bash
npx shipmyagent <command>
```

### Option 3: Project Local

Install as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev shipmyagent
```

Then use with `npx` or add to package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "agent": "shipmyagent",
    "agent:start": "shipmyagent start"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

**"Command not found" after install?**

Add npm global bin to your PATH:

```bash
# Find npm bin path
npm config get prefix

# Add to PATH (macOS/Linux)
export PATH=$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH

# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
echo 'export PATH=$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Permission errors?**

Don't use sudo with npm. Instead:

```bash
# Fix npm permissions
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)



### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
shipmyagent init
```

The interactive setup will ask:

1. **Agent Name**: Give your agent a name (e.g., "my-assistant")
2. **LLM Model**: Pick a model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet recommended for coding)
3. **Adapters (Multi-select)**: Optionally enable Telegram / Feishu / QQ. Only selected adapters are written to `ship.json`.

This creates:

```
your-project/
├── Agent.md           # Agent's system prompt
├── ship.json          # Configuration file
└── .ship/             # Agent data directory
    ├── tasks/         # Scheduled tasks
    ├── logs/          # Operation logs
    └── cache/         # Cached data
```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key

Open `ship.json` and add your API key:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

**Set the environment variable**:

```bash
# Temporary (current session)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Permanent (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

:::warning
Never commit `ship.json` with hardcoded API keys! Always use environment variables.
:::

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Verify your API key works:

```bash
shipmyagent test-llm
```

You should see:

```
✅ LLM connection successful
Provider: Anthropic
Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
Response time: 245ms
```

### Step 4: Customize Your Agent

Edit `Agent.md` to define your agent's role:

```markdown
# Agent Role

You are a senior full-stack developer specializing in React and Node.js.

## Goals

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow best practices and design patterns
- Ensure test coverage for new features
- Review code for security issues

## Context

This project uses:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express
- PostgreSQL database
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Constraints

- Never modify package.json without approval
- All new code must include tests
- Follow existing code style
- Don't refactor without explicit request
```

### Step 5: Start the Agent

Launch your agent:

```bash
shipmyagent .
# `shipmyagent .`: foreground (current terminal)
# `shipmyagent start [path]`: background (daemon)
```

Output:

```
🚀 Starting ShipMyAgent
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%

✅ Configuration loaded
✅ LLM connection established
✅ Agent initialized: my-assistant
✅ Task scheduler started
✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000

🤖 Your agent is now online!
💬 Chat via Telegram (if configured)
📋 View tasks: shipmyagent tasks list
📊 View logs: shipmyagent logs
```


---

## Your First Interaction

### Via CLI

Ask your agent a question:

```bash
shipmyagent chat "What's the purpose of this project?"
```

### Via Telegram (if configured)

Simply send a message to your bot:

```
Hey, can you review the recent changes?
```

The agent will analyze your repository and respond.

If you send multiple follow-up messages before the agent replies, it will merge them as additional context and produce a single final response (fewer back-and-forth turns).

## Verification Checklist

Ensure everything is working:

- [ ] `shipmyagent --version` shows correct version
- [ ] `shipmyagent init` created configuration files
- [ ] `shipmyagent test-llm` shows successful connection
- [ ] `shipmyagent start` launches without errors
- [ ] Agent responds to questions (CLI or Telegram)
- [ ] Logs are being written: `shipmyagent logs --tail 10`

Run the full diagnostic:

```bash
shipmyagent doctor
```

This checks:
- ✅ Node.js version
- ✅ Configuration validity
- ✅ LLM connectivity
- ✅ File permissions
- ✅ Integration status

## Advanced Setup

### Custom Configuration

For non-standard setups:

**Custom LLM endpoint**:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "custom",
    "baseUrl": "https://your-api.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "${CUSTOM_API_KEY}",
    "headers": {
      "X-Custom-Header": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

**Multiple LLMs with fallback**:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "primary": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    },
    "fallback": [
      {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Production Deployment

Running ShipMyAgent in production:

**Use a process manager**:

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start with PM2
pm2 start shipmyagent --name "agent" -- start

# Configure auto-restart
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

**Docker setup**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

RUN npm install -g shipmyagent

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""

CMD ["shipmyagent", "start"]
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  agent:
    build: .
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Agent won't start

```bash
# Check configuration
shipmyagent validate

# View logs
shipmyagent logs --tail 50

# Run diagnostics
shipmyagent doctor
```

**Issue**: API connection fails

```bash
# Test LLM connection
shipmyagent test-llm --verbose

# Check API key
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Test network
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
```

**Issue**: Permissions errors

```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la .ship/

# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 .ship/

# Verify config ownership
ls -l ship.json Agent.md
```
