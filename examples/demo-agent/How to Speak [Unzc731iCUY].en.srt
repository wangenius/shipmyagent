[Music]

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,720
the uh uniform code of military

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,480
Justice specifies Court marshal for any

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,480
officer who sends a soldier into battle

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,000
without a weapon

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
there ought to be a similar protection

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for students because students shouldn't

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,399
go out into life without an ability to

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,960
communicate and that's because your

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,840
success in life will be determined

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,719
largely by your ability to speak your

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,719
ability to write and the quality of your

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,440
ideas in that

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,399
order I know that I can be successful in

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,879
this

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,840
because the quality of

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,760
communication your speaking your writing

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,320
is largely determined by this

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,080
formula it's a matter of how much

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,560
knowledge you have how much you practice

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,159
with that knowledge and you're inherent

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,759
talent and notice that the tea is very

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,720
small what really matters is what you

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,479
know this point came to me U suddenly a

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,079
few decades ago when I was skiing at Sun

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,079
Valley I had heard that it was celebrity

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:33,119
weekend and one of the celebrities was

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:35,880
a was Mary L Reon famous Olympic gymnast

29
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,720
perfect tens in the vault and I heard

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,320
that she was an novice at skiing so when

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,079
the opportune moment arrived I looked

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,479
over on a novice slope and saw this

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,119
young woman who when she became

34
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,479
unbalanced went like that and I said

35
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,280
that's got to be her that must be the

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,159
gymnast but then it occurred to me I'm a

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,039
much better skier than she is and she's

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,119
an Olympic Athlete not only an ordinary

39
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,680
Olympic Athlete an outstanding

40
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,560
one and I was a better skier because I

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,360
had the K and I had the p and all she

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,800
had was the tea so you can get a lot

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,239
better than people who may have inherent

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,640
talents if you have the right amount of

45
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,319
knowledge so that's what my objective is

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,840
today and here's my promise today you

47
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,720
will see

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,720
some examples of what you can put in

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,480
your

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,800
armorium of speaking techniques

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,560
and it will be the casee that someone of

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,640
those examples some urtic some technique

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,879
maybe only one will make will be the one

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
that gets you the

55
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,280
job and so this is a very nonlinear

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,959
process you never know when it's going

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,879
to happen but that is my promise by the

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,400
end of the next 60 Minutes you'll been

59
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,080
exposed to a lot of ideas some of which

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,480
you'll incorporate into your own

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,040
repertoire and they will ensure that you

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,879
get the maximum

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,680
opportunity to uh have your

64
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,959
ideas uh valued and accepted by the

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,799
people you speak with now in order to do

66
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
that we have to have a rule of

67
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,959
Engagement and that

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,400
is no laptops no cell phones so if you

69
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,239
could close those I'll start up as soon

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,360
as you're

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,799
done some people ask why that uh is a is

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,480
a rule

73
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,080
engagement and the answer is we humans

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,879
only have one language processor and if

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,720
your language processor is engage could

76
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,360
you shut the laptop please if your

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,920
language processor is engaged browsing

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,720
the web or reading your email you're

79
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,319
distracted and worse yet you distract

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,680
all the people around you Studies have

81
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,360
shown that and worse yet if I see a open

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,280
laptop somewhere back there or up here

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,000
it drives me nuts and I do a worse job

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,319
and so that ensures that all of your

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
friends who were who are paying

86
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
attention uh don't get the performance

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,440
that they came to

88
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,519
have so that's it for Preamble let's get

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,239
started first thing to talk about of

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,239
course is how to

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,680
start some people think the right thing

92
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,919
to do is to start a talk

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
a

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,199
joke I don't recommend

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,360
it and the reason is that in the

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,560
beginning of a talk people are still

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
putting their laptops away they're

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,639
becoming adjusted to your speaking

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,560
parameters to your vocal

100
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,039
parameters and they're not ready for a

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,360
joke so it doesn't work very well they

102
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,600
usually fall

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,639
flat what you want to do instead is

104
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,639
start with empowerment

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
promise you want to tell people what

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,039
they're going to know at the end of the

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,680
hour that they didn't know at the

108
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,520
beginning of the hour it's an

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,400
empowerment promise it's the reason for

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,280
being

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,120
here uh what would be an example oh I

112
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,479
see at the end of this 60 Minutes you

113
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,039
will know things about speaking you

114
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,360
don't know now and something among those

115
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,800
things you know will be make a

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
difference in your life yeah that's an

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
empowerment promise so that's the best

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
way to

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,120
start so now that I've talked a little

120
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
bit about how to start what I want to do

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,000
is give you some samples of tics that

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,360
are always on my mind when I give a

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,199
talk and first of these

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,440
tics is that it's a good idea to cycle

125
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,240
on the

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,199
subject go around it go around it again

127
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,360
go around

128
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,840
again some people say tell them what you

129
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,960
want to tell

130
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,039
them tell them again and then tell them

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,319
a third time as if

132
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,280
people weren't intelligent but the point

133
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,280
is the reason is well there are many

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
reasons one of which is at any given

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,240
moment about 20% of you will be fogged

136
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,840
out no matter what the lecture is so if

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,960
you want to ensure that the probability

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
that everybody gets it is high you need

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,319
to say it three

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
times so cycling is one of the things

141
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,000
that I always think about when I give a

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,680
talk another thing I think about is in

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,199
explaining my idea I want to build a

144
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,199
fence around

145
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,000
it so that it's not confused with

146
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,160
somebody else's idea so if you were from

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,680
Mars and I was teaching you about what

148
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,160
an arch is I might say to you well

149
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,639
that's an arch and that's not to be

150
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,039
confused with some other things that

151
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,520
other people might think is an AR this

152
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
is not an AR

153
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Arch that's not an arch I'm building a

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,039
fence around my idea so that it can be

155
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,400
distinguished from somebody else's idea

156
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,080
so in a more technical sense I might say

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,960
well my algorithm might similar might

158
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,280
seem similar to Jones's algorithm except

159
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,919
his is exponential and mine's linear

160
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,720
that's putting a fence around your idea

161
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,879
so that people can not be confused about

162
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,960
how it might relate to something

163
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,160
else the third thing on this list of

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,680
samples

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,680
is the idea of verbal

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,000
punctuation and the idea here is that

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,680
because people will uh occasionally fog

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
out and need to get back on the bus you

169
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,199
need to provide some Landmark places

170
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,240
where you're announcing that it's a good

171
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,560
time to get back on

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,720
so I might in this talk say something

173
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
about this being my

174
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
outline the first thing we're going to

175
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,440
do is talk about how to start then we're

176
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,080
going to deal with these four samples

177
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,599
and among these four samples I've talked

178
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,639
about the first idea that's cycling the

179
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,919
second idea building a and now the third

180
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,639
idea is build is verbal

181
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,280
punctuation so I'm enumerating I'm

182
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,159
providing numbers I'm giving you a sense

183
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,440
that there's a seam in the talk and you

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,440
can get back back on

185
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,080
okay so now we're on a

186
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,479
roll uh and since we're on a

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,320
roll can you uh guess what fourth idea

188
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,039
might be here an idea that helps people

189
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,039
get back on the

190
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,040
bus yes ask question ask a question yes

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,440
thank

192
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,440
you so ask a question

193
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
and so I will ask a question how how

194
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,360
much dead air can there be how long can

195
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,839
I pause uh I counted 7 Seconds it seems

196
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,720
like an eternity to me to wait and not

197
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,640
say anything for 10 for 7 seconds but

198
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,240
that's the the standard amount of time

199
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,600
you can wait for an answer and of course

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,320
the question has to be carefully chosen

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,240
it can't be too obvious because then

202
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,519
people will be embarrassed to say what

203
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,600
the answer is can't be too hard because

204
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,839
nobody will have anything to

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,720
say so here are some sample eristics you

206
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:42,720
can put in your armorium and build up

207
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,839
your your repertoire of uh ideas about

208
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,760
presentation and now if this persuades

209
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,839
you that there is something to know that

210
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,120
there there is knowledge then I've

211
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,120
already succeeded because what I want to

212
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,399
convince you of is if you watch the

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,600
speakers you admire and feel are

214
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,320
effective and ask yourselves why they're

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,440
successful then you can build up your

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,680
own personal repertoire and develop your

217
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,880
own personal style and that's that's my

218
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,399
fundamental

219
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,839
objective and the rest of this talk is

220
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,560
about some of the things that are in my

221
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,079
arm inventorium that I think are

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,680
effective so next thing on our agenda as

223
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,519
we start to discuss these other things

224
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,880
is a discussion of time and place so

225
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,000
what do you think is a good time to have

226
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
a lecture

227
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,279
11:00 a.m.

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
yeah and the reason

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,040
is most people at MIT are awake by then

230
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,320
and hardly anyone is going back to

231
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,680
sleep it's not right after a meal people

232
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,959
aren't fatigued from this or that it's a

233
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,200
great time to have a

234
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,920
lecture so that brings me next to the

235
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,639
question of what about the place and the

236
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,519
most important thing about the place is

237
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,519
that it be well

238
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,600
lit this room is well

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,240
lit problem with the other kinds of

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,040
rooms is that we

241
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,800
humans uh whenever the lights go down or

242
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,480
whe whenever the room is dimly lighted

243
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,120
it signals that we should go to sleep so

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,480
whenever I go somewhere to give a talk

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,120
even today the first thing I do when I

246
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,040
speak to the audiovisual people is say

247
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,040
keep the lights full

248
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,959
up oh they might

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,560
reply people will see the slides better

250
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,079
if we turn the lights off and then I

251
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,680
reply it's extremely hard to see slides

252
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,680
through closed

253
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,040
eyelids what else can you say about the

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,040
place well the place should be

255
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:03,279
cased and I mean that in the clal sense

256
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,560
of like uh if you're robbing a bank you

257
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,279
would go to the bank you know some some

258
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,800
occasions before to see what it's like

259
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,160
so there are no surprises when you uh

260
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,480
when you do your

261
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,399
robbery so uh whenever I go somewhere to

262
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,800
speak the first thing I ask my host to

263
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,199
do is to take me to the place where I'll

264
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,920
be speaking so that there any

265
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:27,320
weirdnesses I'll be able to

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,480
um to deal with it uh sometimes it might

267
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,880
require some intervention some time it

268
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,600
just might require me to understand what

269
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:39,279
the challenges are so when I came here

270
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,839
this morning I did what I typically do I

271
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,320
imagined that all the seats were filled

272
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,600
with disinterested farm

273
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,880
animals that way I knew that no matter

274
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,880
how bad it was it wouldn't be as bad as

275
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,720
that so uh finally it should be

276
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,720
reasonably it should be reasonably

277
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
populated

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
it should

279
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,279
be it should be the case that you know

280
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,199
if there are 10 people in this Hall

281
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,680
everyone would be wondering what's going

282
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,360
on that's so much more interesting that

283
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,880
nobody's here so you want to get a right

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,839
siiz place that's doesn't have to be

285
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,720
packed but it has to be more than half

286
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,480
full so those are some thoughts about uh

287
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,560
time and place next thing I want to talk

288
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,079
about is uh subject of uh bo boards and

289
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,079
props and

290
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:44,079
slides well these are the tools of the

291
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:48,880
trade uh I uh believe that this is the

292
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:51,160
uh this is the the right tool for uh

293
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,279
speaking when your purpose is uh

294
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,600
informing uh the slides are good when

295
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,600
your purpose is uh exposing but this is

296
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
what I use when I'm informing teaching

297
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,199
lecturing

298
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,480
and there are several reasons why I use

299
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,360
it for one thing when you use the board

300
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
you have a Graphic

301
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,639
quality it's the case that when you have

302
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:21,920
a board then you can easily exploit the

303
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,839
fact that you can use Graphics in your

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,279
presentation so that's the graphic

305
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,560
quality that I like and next thing I

306
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,560
like is like a speed property

307
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,839
the speed with which you write on the

308
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,480
Blackboard is approximately the speed at

309
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,920
which people can absorb ideas if you go

310
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
flipping through a bunch of slides

311
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
nobody can go that

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,320
fast finally one great property of a

313
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,320
board is that it's can be a

314
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,600
Target many people

315
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,839
who are novices at speaking find

316
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,279
themselves uh suddenly aware of their

317
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,000
hands it's as if their hands were

318
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,720
private parts that shouldn't be exposed

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,160
in public so right away they go into the

320
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,600
pockets and this is considered insulting

321
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,399
in some parts of the world or

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,839
alternatively maybe the hands will go in

323
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,000
in back like this I was once in a

324
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,720
Convent in

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,040
Serbia and uh my uh host U well we were

326
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,360
as soon as we entered a nun came up to

327
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,680
us and offered us a refreshment and I

328
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,240
was about to say no thank you when he

329
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,720
said eat that stuff or

330
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,440
die it's a question of local custom and

331
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,720
and politeness but then uh before

332
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,639
anything happened there uh the nun

333
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,240
pulled my hands off like this because it

334
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,880
was extraordinarily insulting in that

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,000
culture to have your hands behind your

336
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,360
back so uh why is that well it's it's

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,720
usually supposed that that's what that

338
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
has to do with whether you're concealing

339
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,440
a weapon so if your hands are in your

340
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:10,079
pockets behind your back then um it

341
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,360
looks like you might have a weapon and

342
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,399
that's what I mean by The Virtue one of

343
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,759
these virtues of the board now you have

344
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,720
something to do with your hands you can

345
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,720
point out the

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,959
stuff I was once watching Seymour paper

347
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,639
give a lecture I thought it was terrific

348
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,399
so I went a second time first time to

349
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,639
absorb the content second time to note

350
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
the style

351
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,120
and what I discovered is that papet was

352
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,399
constantly pointing at the board and

353
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,040
then I thought about a little while and

354
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,720
I noted that none of the stuff he was

355
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,040
pointing to had anything to do with what

356
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,040
he was

357
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,399
saying nevertheless it was a effective

358
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,880
technique so that's a just a little bit

359
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,120
about the the virtue of of of black

360
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,959
boards and now I want to talk about

361
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,880
props you know the custodians of

362
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:03,680
knowledge about props s are the

363
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,720
playwrights many decades ago I saw a

364
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,000
play by Hinrich Ipson it was head of

365
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,919
gabbler I remember vaguely there was

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,520
about a woman in an unhappy marriage and

367
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,760
her husband was in competition for an

368
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,919
academic job with somebody else and he

369
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,799
was going to lose partly because he was

370
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,880
boring and partly because the competitor

371
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,400
had just written a magnificent book by

372
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,280
the way this is back in the days before

373
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,760
they were copying machines and comp

374
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,880
computers any anyhow as the play

375
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,880
opens there's a pot bellied

376
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,760
stove and in the beginning of the

377
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,960
play uh the putt belly stove with its

378
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,360
open door just has some uh slightly

379
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,919
glowing

380
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,480
Embers but the P stove is always there

381
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,200
and it tension mounts in the play

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,240
uh and you see this manuscript this prop

383
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,520
that Ipson so artfully used you just

384
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,400
know that something's going to happen

385
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,960
because as the play goes on the Fire

386
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,640
gets bigger and hotter and finally all

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,080
consuming and you just know that that

388
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,960
manuscript is going to go into that

389
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,080
fire it's memorable thing it's what I

390
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,600
remember about

391
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,320
play so the play rights have got this

392
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,240
all figured out

393
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,760
uh but on the other hand they're not the

394
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,200
only people who can use props here's an

395
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,240
example of the use of a prop also due to

396
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,320
sear paper he was talking about how it's

397
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,159
important to look at the problem in the

398
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,600
right way and here's an example that uh

399
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,960
not only teaches that but makes it

400
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,320
possible for you to embarrass your

401
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
friends in mechanical engineering so

402
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,159
here's here's what you do take this

403
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,400
bicycle wheel you start it spinning and

404
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,120
then you put some

405
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,240
torque on the axle or

406
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,799
equivalently you blow on the edge and

407
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,960
the issue is does it go that way or does

408
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,640
it go that way now the mechanical

409
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,640
engineers will immediately say oh yes I

410
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,080
see right hand screw and they'll put

411
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,600
their fingers in this position but

412
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,799
forget exactly how to align their

413
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,320
fingers with various aspects of the

414
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,159
problem and so it's you usually the case

415
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:37,080
that they get it right with about a 50%

416
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:39,039
probability so they um very fancy

417
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,159
education gets them up to the point

418
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,640
where they're equivalent to flipping a

419
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,200
coin but it doesn't have to be that way

420
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,720
because you can think about the problem

421
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,760
a little differently so here's what you

422
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,280
do you take some duct tape and you uh

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,720
put it around part of the wheel like

424
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,520
that and now you start to think about

425
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,039
not the whole wheel but just the little

426
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,720
piece that's underneath the duct tape so

427
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,840
here that piece comes rolling over the

428
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,280
top and at this point you blow on it

429
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,799
with a puff of air forgetting about the

430
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,559
rest of the wheel what happens to that

431
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,559
little piece that's under the duct tape

432
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,200
it must want to go that way cuz you bang

433
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,919
on it like that it's already going down

434
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,400
like that and what about the next piece

435
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,080
same thing next piece same thing so the

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,440
only thing that can happen is the wheel

437
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,679
goes over like that and so now you'll

438
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,039
never Wonder again because you're

439
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,000
thinking about the problem in the right

440
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,640
way and it's

441
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,640
demonstrated by the use of a

442
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,919
problem you can try this after we're

443
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,720
done another example I like to remember

444
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:52,640
is one from when I was taking

445
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,760
801 Alan Lazarus was the instructor at

446
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,320
the time and he was talking about the

447
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,440
conservation of energy kinetic and

448
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,039
potential

449
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,480
and there was a long wire in the ceiling

450
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:09,559
in 26 100 attached to a much bigger

451
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,559
steel Ball but one not un like this and

452
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,440
Lazarus uh took the

453
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,279
ball up against the wall like this he

454
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,200
put his head flat against the wall to

455
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,880
steady

456
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,720
himself and then uh he let go and the

457
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,960
Pendulum takes many seconds ago over and

458
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,200
back and then uh gently uh kisses

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,640
lazarus's

460
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,480
nose and so you have many seconds to

461
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,159
think this guy really believes in the

462
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,159
conservation of

463
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:49,240
energy um do not try this at

464
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,720
home the problem is that uh first time

465
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:57,240
you do this you may not just let go

466
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,240
there's a natural human tendency to push

467
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,279
so uh that's a little bit on a subject

468
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,279
of

469
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,640
props you know it's interesting whenever

470
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,799
surveys are taken students always say

471
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,159
more chalk less

472
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,200
PowerPoint and uh why would that be uh

473
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,600
props are always also very

474
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,320
effective why would that be uh I'll give

475
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,799
you my Lunatic Fringe view on this it um

476
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,279
has to do with

477
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,279
uh what I would call

478
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
empathetic

479
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,279
mirroring when you're sitting up there

480
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
watching me right on the board all those

481
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,919
little mirror neurons in your head I

482
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,159
believe become actuated and you can feel

483
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,960
yourself writing on the Blackboard and

484
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:19,159
even more so uh when I uh talk about

485
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,159
this steel ball going that way and this

486
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,520
way you can you can you can feel the

487
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,080
ball as if you were me and you can't do

488
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,320
that with a slide you can't do it with a

489
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,039
picture you need to see see it uh in in

490
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,880
the physical world that's why I think

491
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,720
that oh yes of course it's it's there

492
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,200
there speed questions involved too that

493
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,880
have to be separated out but I think the

494
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,919
empathetic mirroring is why props and

495
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,559
the use of a Blackboard are so

496
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,679
effective

497
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,120
well let's

498
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:57,400
see oh yes there is one more thing by

499
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:01,080
way of uh the tools and that has to do

500
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,080
with the uh use of

501
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,200
slides I repeat I think they're for

502
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,279
exposing ideas not for teaching ideas

503
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,360
but that's what we do in a job talk or

504
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,080
conference talk we expose ideas we don't

505
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,279
teach them so let me tell you a little

506
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:23,200
bit about my views on that

507
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,960
um I remember once I was

508
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,720
um in um Terminal

509
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,240
A had Logan airport I just come back

510
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,600
from a really miserable conference and

511
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,600
the flight was really horrible it was

512
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,360
one of those that feels like an

513
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,120
unbalanced washing machine and for the

514
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,080
only time in my life I decided to uh

515
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,880
stop on my way to my car and have a cup

516
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,559
of coffee and relax a little bit and I

517
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,120
as I was there for a few minutes uh

518
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,640
someone came up to me and said uh are

519
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,799
you Professor

520
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,039
Winston I think so I

521
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,720
said I don't know I guess I was trying

522
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,240
to be funny in any event uh he said I'm

523
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,360
on my way to Europe to give a job talk

524
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,960
would you mind critiquing my

525
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,679
slides not at all I said you have too

526
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,840
many and they have too many

527
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,200
words how did you know he said thinking

528
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,120
perhaps I'd seen a talk of his before I

529
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,480
hadn't uh my reply was because it's

530
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,559
always true there are always too many

531
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,320
slides always too many words so let me

532
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,880
show you some extreme examples of how

533
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,880
not to use

534
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:40,320
slides well for this demonstration I

535
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,320
need to be uh way over

536
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:47,399
here um and uh when I get over here then

537
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,480
I can start to say things like

538
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,360
U one of the things you shouldn't do is

539
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,279
read your

540
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,840
transparencies people in your audience

541
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,679
know how to read and reading will just

542
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,520
annoy them also you should be sure that

543
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,080
you have only a few words on each

544
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,720
transparency and that the words are easy

545
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,440
to read and I hope it driving you

546
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,760
crazy because I'm committing uh all

547
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,520
kinds of crimes the first of which is

548
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,960
that there are too many words on this

549
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,600
slide second of which is I'm way over

550
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,559
there and it slides away over there so

551
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,320
you get into this uh tennis match

552
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,600
feeling of uh shifting back and forth

553
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,640
between the slide and the speaker you

554
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,080
want the slides to be uh condiments to

555
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,880
what you're saying not the main event or

556
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,919
the opposite way around so how can we

557
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,320
fix this step number one is to get rid

558
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,600
of the background junk that's always

559
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,480
distraction uh step number two is to get

560
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,279
rid of the

561
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,960
words when I reduceed the the words to

562
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:51,039
these then everything I

563
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,279
read a previous time I'm not licensed to

564
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,360
say because it's not on the slide I'm

565
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,480
not reading my slides anymore but I'm

566
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,799
saying what was written on the slides in

567
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,000
a previous

568
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,720
example so what else can we do to

569
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,799
simplify

570
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,760
this well we can get rid of the logos we

571
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,919
don't need

572
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,320
them

573
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,399
simplification what else can we

574
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,640
do get rid of the

575
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:21,320
title now I want to talk to you about

576
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,440
some rules for slide preparation I'm

577
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,039
telling you the title doesn't have to be

578
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,600
up there by reducing the number of words

579
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,120
on the slide I'm allowing you pay more

580
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,279
attention to me unless to what's written

581
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,679
on the

582
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,279
slide I mentioned it before we have only

583
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,080
one language processor and we can either

584
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:42,159
use it to read stuff or to listen to the

585
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,120
speaker and so if we have too many words

586
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,919
on the slide forces people in the

587
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,919
audience to read this stuff and not

588
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,080
listen student of mine did an experiment

589
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,000
a few years ago uh he taught some

590
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,080
students some

591
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,159
um web based programming

592
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,880
ideas half the information was on slides

593
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,840
he said the other half and then for a

594
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,039
control group he reversed it and the

595
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,120
question was what did the subjects that

596
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,000
is to say freshman in his fraternity

597
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,919
what did the subjects remember

598
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,120
best what he

599
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,279
said or what they read on the

600
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,640
slide and the answer

601
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:27,760
is what they read on the

602
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,120
slide when their slides have a lot of

603
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,240
material on it they don't pay attention

604
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,640
to the speaker in fact in the after

605
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,360
Action Report one of the subjects said I

606
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,360
wish you hadn't talked so much it was

607
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,919
distracting well that last item is

608
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,399
eliminate

609
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,559
clutter I hear some clutter no no no

610
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,000
reason even for those

611
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,480
bullets so the too many words problem is

612
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,799
a consequence of h a crime Microsoft has

613
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,279
committed by allowing you to use funds

614
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,320
that are too small

615
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,320
so you should all have a sample slide

616
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,440
like this that you can use to determine

617
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,000
what the minimum Fun Size is that's

618
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,919
that's easily leisurable shiv what do

619
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,760
you think of

620
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,840
those which size is right what's that

621
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,320
size is right yeah minimum maybe 40 or

622
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,200
50 yeah he says 40 or 50 I think it's

623
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,720
about right 35 is get too small not

624
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,960
necessarily because you can't read it

625
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,279
but because it because you're probably

626
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,840
using it to get too many words on the

627
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:43,120
slide what other crimes do we

628
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,679
have well we have the laser pointer

629
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,960
crime not for that I you know in the old

630
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,159
days when we didn't have laser pointers

631
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,600
we used wooden ones and people would go

632
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,600
waving these things around

633
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,720
and pretty soon it became almost like a

634
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,120
the CH swirling contest so here's what

635
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,679
here's what I recommended in the old

636
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,679
days for dealing with this kind of

637
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,200
pointer this example of used of a

638
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,559
prop Jim glass up there saw this talk

639
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,679
about 20 years ago and uh so oh yeah I

640
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,120
remembered that talk that's the one

641
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,919
where you broke the

642
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,399
pointer it's amazing how props uh tend

643
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,880
to be the things that are

644
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,080
remembered well now oh we don't have uh

645
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,720
we don't have physical pointers anymore

646
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,519
we've got uh we got laser pointers

647
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,480
that's a Wonder more people aren't

648
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,039
driven into epileptic fits over this

649
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,120
sort of stuff but here's what tends to

650
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,799
happen look at that it's a lovely

651
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,080
recursive picture and I can become part

652
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,320
of it by putting that laser beam right

653
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,320
on the back of my head up

654
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:00,000
there and what do you see

655
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,840
you see the back of my

656
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,720
head I'm have no eye contact no

657
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,519
engagement nothing I was sitting with a

658
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,679
student watching a talk one day and she

659
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,360
said you know what we could all leave

660
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,360
and he wouldn't

661
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,799
know so what happens when you use a

662
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,120
laser pointer you can't use a laser

663
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,880
pointer without turning your head and

664
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,440
pointing it at something and when you do

665
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,559
that you lose uh you lose contact with

666
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,880
the audience you don't want to do it so

667
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,720
what do you do if you need to need to

668
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,240
identify something in your image and you

669
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,799
don't want to point at it with a laser

670
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,159
this is what you do put a little arrow

671
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,960
on there and say now look at that guy

672
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,240
number one at the end of Arrow number

673
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,600
one you don't need to have laser pointer

674
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,600
to do

675
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,880
that the to heavy

676
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,639
crime when people ask me to review a

677
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,840
presentation I ask them to print it out

678
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,840
and lay it out on a table

679
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,240
when they do that it's easy to see

680
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:09,399
whether the talk is too heavy too much

681
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,720
text not enough air not enough white

682
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,200
space not enough

683
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,840
imagery this is a good example of uh

684
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,760
such a talk way too

685
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,399
heavy uh the uh presenter has taken

686
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,440
advantage of uh small font sizes to get

687
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,440
as much on the slide as he

688
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,440
wanted lots of crimes here but uh the

689
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,000
too heaviness the fact that it's too

690
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,200
heavy is what I wanted to illustrate so

691
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,840
here by contrast another talk one I gave

692
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,440
a few years ago it's not it wasn't a

693
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,200
deeply technical talk but I show it to

694
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,720
you

695
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,240
because there's air in

696
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,480
it it's mostly pictures of things there

697
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,200
are three or four slides that have text

698
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,639
on them but when I come to those I give

699
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,880
the audience time to read them and

700
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,760
they're there because they might have

701
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,399
have some historical significance the

702
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,080
first slide with a lot of text on it is

703
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,480
a extraction from the

704
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,799
1957 from the for the from the proposal

705
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,240
for the 1957 AI conference at Dartmouth

706
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,480
extraordinarily interesting event and

707
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,720
that

708
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,880
historical extraction from The Proposal

709
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,240
helps drive that point

710
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,919
home what else have we got here oh yeah

711
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,679
your vocabulary word for the day this is

712
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,760
an NAX Lon

713
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,080
what that means is this is the kind of

714
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,480
slide you can get away with exactly once

715
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,639
in your

716
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,760
presentation this is a slide that got

717
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,200
some currency some years ago because it

718
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,480
shows the

719
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,519
complexity of um governing in

720
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,840
Afghanistan by showing how impossibly

721
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,679
complex it is it's something we you in

722
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,360
the audience can't understand and and

723
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,519
that's the point but you can't have many

724
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,720
of these you can have one per work one

725
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,039
per presentation one per paper one per

726
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,760
book that's what it that's what epex Lan

727
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,040
is and this is an example of

728
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,679
it well I've shown you some crimes and

729
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,639
so you might be asking do these crimes

730
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,879
actually

731
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,040
occur so

732
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,040
um they

733
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,040
do there's the hands in the pockets

734
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,200
crime there's a um crime and time and

735
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,800
place selection

736
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,800
here this is how you get to the BTO

737
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,200
theater first thing you do is you get

738
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,040
down these steps over at the media

739
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:46,599
lab then you cross this large open

740
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,639
space then you turn right down this

741
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,480
Corridor this point whenever I go in

742
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,879
there I wonder if if there are torture

743
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,280
implements around the corner and then

744
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,480
when you get in there you get into this

745
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,599
dark gloomy place so it's well- named

746
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,880
what when they call it the baros theater

747
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,240
because it's a place where you can watch

748
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,680
a movie but it's not a place where you

749
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,680
can give a

750
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:12,359
talk now on a subject that doesn't

751
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,839
happen here's a talk I attended a while

752
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,320
back in

753
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,960
stada notice that the speaker is H far

754
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,680
away from the slides speaker is using a

755
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,200
laser

756
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,520
pointer and you say to me

757
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:30,160
well what's happening here it's by the

758
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,320
way the 80th 80th slide in the

759
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,839
presentation notice that it stent with

760
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,839
words this is the first of 10 conclusion

761
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,640
slides so uh what's the audience

762
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,320
reaction that's the sponsor of the

763
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,040
meeting he's reading his

764
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,290
email this is the co-sponsor of the

765
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,520
meeting he's examining the lunch

766
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:58,160
[Music]

767
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
menu what about this person

768
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,960
this person looks like he's paying

769
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,240
attention but this because it's a still

770
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,920
picture if you were to see a video what

771
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,920
you would see is something like

772
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:21,000
this so yeah it it it does

773
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:25,560
happen well now uh that's a a quick

774
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,560
review of of tools now I want to talk

775
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,560
about some special cases

776
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,240
we could talk a little bit about uh

777
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,960
informing or to say it another way doing

778
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,319
what I'm doing

779
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,640
now but I'll just say a few words about

780
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:42,920
that uh in that kind of in that kind of

781
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,200
presentation you want to start with a

782
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,560
promise like I did for this for this uh

783
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,680
for this hour that we're going through

784
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,920
now but then it comes to the question of

785
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,119
how do you inspire

786
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,680
people I've given this talk for a long

787
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,720
time and a few years ago um uh our

788
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,560
department chairman said would you

789
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,400
please give this talk to uh a new

790
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,480
faculty and be sure to emphasize what it

791
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,800
takes to inspire students and strangely

792
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,640
I hadn't thought about that question

793
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,520
before so I started a survey I talked to

794
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,880
some of my incoming freshman advises and

795
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,240
I talked to senior faculty and

796
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,480
everything in between about how they've

797
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,520
been

798
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,520
inspired what I found from the uh

799
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,319
incoming freshman is that they were

800
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,880
inspired by some high school teacher who

801
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:31,119
told them they could do it

802
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,560
what I found in the senior

803
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,480
faculty they um were inspired by someone

804
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,760
who helped them to see a problem in a

805
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,800
new way and what I saw from

806
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,960
everyone is that they were

807
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,599
inspired when someone exhibited passion

808
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,760
about what they were

809
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,680
doing exhibited passion about what they

810
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,640
were

811
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,640
doing yeah so that's uh that's one one

812
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,599
way to be inspiring

813
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,000
it's easy for me because you know I do

814
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,240
artificial

815
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,640
intelligence um and uh how how can you

816
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,800
not be interested in artificial

817
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,760
intelligence right I mean if you're not

818
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,079
interested in artificial intelligence

819
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,599
you're probably not interested in

820
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,599
interesting

821
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,240
things so uh when I'm lecturing uh in my

822
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,160
AI class it's natural for me to talk

823
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,839
about what I think is cool and how

824
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,400
exciting some new idea is uh so that's

825
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,800
the kind of that's the kind of

826
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,640
expression of passion that makes a

827
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,480
difference uh while informing with

828
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,480
respect to this question of of of

829
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,520
inspiring oh yeah and of course during

830
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,520
this promise phase you can also Express

831
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,920
how cool stuff is let me give you an

832
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,040
example of a lecture that starts this

833
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,040
way I'm talking about resource

834
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,880
allocation it's the same sort of stuff

835
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,240
you would think of when you're s it's

836
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,760
the same sort of ideas you would need if

837
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,680
you're

838
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,800
allocating a aircraft to a flight

839
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,599
schedule or trying to schedule a factory

840
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,480
or something like that but the example

841
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,560
is putting colors on the states in the

842
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,680
United States without any bordering

843
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,680
states having the same color so here it

844
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:19,480
goes this is what I show in the

845
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:22,119
beginning of the class this is a way of

846
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,359
doing that coloring and you might say

847
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:29,359
well why don't we wait till it

848
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:29,359
finishes would you like to do that no

849
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,359
well we're not going to wait till it

850
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,280
finishes because the sun will have

851
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,000
exploded and consumed the Earth before

852
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,319
this program

853
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,839
finishes but with a slight adjustment to

854
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,680
how the program works which I tell my

855
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,400
students you will understand in the next

856
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,400
50 minutes this is what you

857
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,599
get Isn't that cool you know you got you

858
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:56,960
got to be you got to be amazed by stuff

859
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,680
that takes a computation from longer

860
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,000
than the lifetime of the solar system

861
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:05,880
into a few seconds so that's what I mean

862
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,280
by providing a promise up front and

863
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,319
expressing some passion about what

864
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,720
you're talking

865
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:14,560
about well the last item in this little

866
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,560
block here is uh uh it has to do with

867
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,800
what people think that they do at MIT

868
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,960
you ask a faculty what the most

869
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,520
important purpose is and they'll say

870
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,000
well uh the most important thing I do is

871
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,359
teach people how to

872
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,839
think and then uh you say oh that's

873
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:34,079
great how do you teach people how to

874
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,760
think Blank

875
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,960
Stare no one can quite respond to that

876
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,119
part that natural next question so how

877
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,839
do you teach people how to think

878
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:51,079
well I believe that we are storytelling

879
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,119
animals and that uh we start to

880
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,440
developing our story understanding and

881
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,000
manipulating skills with fairy tales in

882
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,040
childhood and continue on through

883
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,040
professional schools like law business

884
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,920
medicine engineer everything and we

885
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,640
continue doing that throughout life so

886
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,240
if uh that is what thinking is all about

887
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,560
then when you want to teach people how

888
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,920
to think you provide them with the

889
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,040
stories they need to know the questions

890
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,280
they need to ask about those stories

891
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,280
mechanisms for analyzing those stories

892
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,480
ways of putting stories together ways of

893
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,000
evaluating

894
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,520
how reliable the story is and that's

895
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,079
what I think you need to do when you

896
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,319
teach people how to

897
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:36,280
think but that's all about education and

898
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:40,160
uh many of you here not necessarily for

899
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,079
that but rather for uh for this part for

900
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,480
persuading which breaks down into

901
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,599
several categories oral exams not shown

902
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,480
job talks getting famous I won't say

903
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,200
much about oral exams other than the

904
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,040
fact that they used to be a lot scarier

905
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,240
than they are today in the old

906
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,720
days um

907
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,599
reading the literature in a foreign

908
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,839
language was a part of that and there

909
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,079
was a a high failure rate and when you

910
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,520
look at when you look back on those uh

911
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,520
on those failures the most uh usual

912
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,440
reason for people failing an oral exam

913
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:19,720
is failure to situate and a failure to

914
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,960
practice by situate I mean it's

915
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,400
important to talk about your research

916
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,599
and context uh this is a problem that's

917
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,720
being pursued all over the world there

918
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,880
hasn't been any progress before me in

919
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,680
past 30

920
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,599
years um everyone is looking for a

921
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,119
solution because it will have impact on

922
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,200
so many other things so that's situating

923
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,720
in time and place and field and then as

924
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,680
far as practice is

925
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,119
concerned yes practice is important but

926
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,280
that doesn't mean uh showing your slides

927
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,040
to the people who share an office with

928
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,480
the problem with that is that um if

929
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,000
people know what you're doing they will

930
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,920
hallucinate that there's material in

931
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,960
your presentation that isn't there it it

932
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,119
isn't

933
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,559
there a variation on the scene by the

934
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,160
way is your faculty supervisor is not a

935
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,359
very good person to help you debug a

936
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,000
talk because they in fact know what

937
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,839
you're doing and they will in fact

938
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,359
hallucinate there's material in your

939
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,800
presentation that isn't there so you

940
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,119
need to get together some friends who

941
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,359
don't know what you're doing and have

942
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,000
them well you start the practice session

943
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:27,920
by saying if you can't make me cry I

944
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,200
won't value you as a friend friend

945
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,160
anymore and then when you get to the

946
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:36,160
faculty uh on a uh oral exam it will be

947
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,079
easy you see

948
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,880
um difficulty the amount of flack you

949
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,000
get from somebody is proportional to age

950
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,280
the older somebody is the more uh the

951
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,319
more they understand where they are in

952
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,880
the world but but the young people are

953
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,680
trying to show the old people how smart

954
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,839
they are so so sobly vicious so whenever

955
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,760
you have an opportunity to have an

956
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,520
examining committee that's full of

957
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,720
people with gray hair that's what you

958
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,480
want well that's just a word or two

959
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,520
about something I haven't listed here

960
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,880
let's get into the subject of job talks

961
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,000
so I was

962
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:15,640
um sitting in a bar uh many years ago uh

963
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,359
in uh San Diego I was a member of the

964
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,240
Navy science board and I was saying with

965
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,760
a couple of uh my colleagues on the

966
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,520
board uh Dolores Eder from the

967
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,440
University of Colorado uh she made me so

968
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,559
jealous I could spit because she written

969
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,440
21 books and I'd only written

970
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:37,079
177 and then the other one was

971
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,680
uh bill welon from the University of

972
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,359
Texas he was a electrom magnetism guy

973
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,559
and he know knew how to use rail guns to

974
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,000
to drive steel rods through tank armor

975
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,240
these are interesting people so I said

976
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,960
um what do you look for uh in a uh

977
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:57,559
faculty

978
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,079
candidate and uh within a one microc

979
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,720
Dolores said they have to show us

980
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,839
they've got some kind of

981
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:09,200
vision quickly followed by Bill who said

982
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,200
they have to show us that they've done

983
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,760
something oh that sounds good I said and

984
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,559
then I said to them how long does the

985
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,160
candidate have to establish these two

986
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:30,079
things what do you think

987
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,079
compare your answer to

988
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,119
theirs 5

989
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,760
minutes so if you haven't expressed your

990
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,079
vision if you haven't told people that

991
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,240
you've done something in five minutes

992
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,839
you're you you've already lost so you

993
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
you have to be able to do that and let

994
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,240
me just mention a couple of things in

995
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,280
that

996
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,240
connection here which is you know the

997
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:58,000
vision is in part a problem that

998
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,000
somebody cares about

999
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,880
and something new in your

1000
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,640
approach so the problem is understanding

1001
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the nature of human intelligence and the

1002
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,000
approach is asking questions about what

1003
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,160
makes us different from chimpanzees and

1004
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,200
neandertals is it merely a matter of

1005
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,920
quantity or we just a little bit smarter

1006
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,400
in some continuous way or do we have

1007
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,520
something that's fundamentally different

1008
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,640
the chimpan Tendencies don't have and

1009
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,920
the Andals either and the answer is yes

1010
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,960
we do have something different we are

1011
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,520
symbolic

1012
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,440
creatures and because we're symbolic

1013
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:44,520
creatures we can

1014
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,040
um we can uh build symbolic descriptions

1015
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,200
of relations and events we can string

1016
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,520
them together and make stories and

1017
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,680
because we can make stories that's what

1018
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,359
makes us different so that's that's

1019
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,160
that's my stump speech that's how I

1020
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,200
start most of my talks on my my own

1021
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,400
personal

1022
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,079
research how do you express the notion

1023
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,800
that you've done

1024
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,359
something by listing the steps that need

1025
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,000
to be taken in order to achieve the

1026
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:14,680
solution to that problem you don't have

1027
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,280
to have done all of those steps but you

1028
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:20,119
can say here's here's what needs to be

1029
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,319
done an example here's what needs to be

1030
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,800
done we need to specify some Behavior we

1031
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,599
need to enumerate the constraints that

1032
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,040
make it possible to deal with that

1033
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,400
behavior we have to implement a system

1034
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,119
because we're engineers and we don't

1035
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,760
think that we've understood something

1036
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,319
unless we can build it and we've built

1037
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,680
such a system and we're about to

1038
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,200
demonstrate it to you today that would

1039
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,240
be an example of enumerating series of

1040
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,160
steps needed to realize the

1041
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,520
vision so then blah blah blah blah blah

1042
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,280
blah blah blah blah and then you

1043
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:56,599
conclude by you conclude by enumerating

1044
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,599
your contributions

1045
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,480
it's kind of mirror of of these steps

1046
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,800
and helps to establish that you've done

1047
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,240
something so that's a kind of general

1048
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,960
purpose framework for doing a technical

1049
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,520
talk

1050
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,640
now only a few more things left to do

1051
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,079
today uh getting famous is the next item

1052
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,000
on our agenda because once you've got

1053
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,599
the job you need to think a little bit

1054
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,720
about how you're going to be recognized

1055
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,720
for what you

1056
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,720
do so

1057
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,879
[Music]

1058
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,000
well first of all why should you care

1059
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,880
about getting

1060
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,280
famous I thought about this um in

1061
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,960
connection with

1062
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,960
a fundraising event I attended

1063
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,799
once fundraising event for raising money

1064
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,119
to save Venice from going underwater and

1065
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:57,040
having all of its art destroyed anyway I

1066
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,160
was sitting here

1067
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:05,000
and JC was sitting

1068
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:05,000
here that was uh Julia the late Julia

1069
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,200
Child and as the evening wore on more

1070
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,720
and more people would come up and ask

1071
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Julia to autograph something or Express

1072
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,280
a a feeling that she had changed their

1073
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,559
life and it just happened over and over

1074
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:29,319
again So eventually I turned to Julia

1075
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,400
and I said Miss child is it fun to be

1076
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:34,839
famous and she thought about it for a

1077
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,119
second and she said you get used to

1078
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:40,440
it but you know what occurred to me you

1079
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,799
never get used to being

1080
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,280
ignored so it's you know it's it's

1081
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:47,599
here's a way to think about it your

1082
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,200
ideas are like your children and you

1083
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,640
don't want them to go into the world in

1084
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,920
rags so what you want to do is to be

1085
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,480
sure that you have

1086
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,319
these techniques these mechanisms these

1087
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,440
thoughts about how to present the ideas

1088
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,359
that you have so that they're recognized

1089
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,520
for the value that that is in them so

1090
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:07,000
that's why it's a legitimate thing to

1091
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,119
concern yourself with the with

1092
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,440
packaging now how do you get uh

1093
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,680
remembered well there's something I like

1094
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:19,720
to call Winston star and every one of

1095
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,000
the items I'm about to articulate has a

1096
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,440
starts with an

1097
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,720
S so if you want your presentation ideas

1098
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,920
to be remembered one of the things you

1099
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,319
need to do is to make sure that you have

1100
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,880
some kind of

1101
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:37,160
symbol associated with your work so this

1102
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,440
Arch example is actually from my PhD

1103
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,680
thesis many many years ago

1104
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,640
and in the course of uh my work uh at

1105
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,640
that time uh this work on Arch learning

1106
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,160
became mildly famous and I didn't know

1107
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,799
why it was only many years later that I

1108
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,319
realized that that work accidentally had

1109
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:58,680
all of the elements on this star so the

1110
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:02,440
first element is that there was a kind

1111
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,440
of symbol it's the arch

1112
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,960
itself next thing you need is some kind

1113
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,960
of

1114
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,680
slogan a kind of phrase that provides a

1115
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:18,720
handle on the work and in this case the

1116
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,720
phrase was one shot

1117
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,240
learning and it was one shot because the

1118
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,240
program I wrote learned something

1119
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,799
definite from every example that was

1120
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,359
presented to us so in going from a model

1121
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:34,880
based on this configuration to something

1122
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,839
that isn't an arch based on that

1123
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,359
configuration the program learned that

1124
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:43,240
it has to be on top one shot

1125
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:48,240
learning so that's a

1126
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,240
simple slogan now we need a

1127
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,880
surprise yeah the surprise is you don't

1128
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,760
need a million examples of something to

1129
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,280
learn you can do it with one example if

1130
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,720
you're smart enough to make use of that

1131
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,240
example appropriately so that was the

1132
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,079
surprise you can learn something

1133
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,400
definite from each

1134
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,400
example next item was a Salient

1135
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,680
idea now when I say Salient idea I don't

1136
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,799
mean important what I mean is an idea

1137
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,319
that sticks

1138
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:23,040
out

1139
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,640
uh some some thesis funnily enough have

1140
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,400
too many good ideas and you don't know

1141
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,160
what it's all about because which one is

1142
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,520
it it so you need an idea that sticks

1143
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,440
out and the idea that stuck out

1144
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,440
here was a notion of a near

1145
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,920
miss you see this is not an arch but it

1146
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,480
doesn't miss by much so it's a near

1147
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,799
Miss

1148
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:53,480
finally you need to tell the

1149
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:54,920
story of how you did it how it works why

1150
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,119
it's

1151
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,280
important so that's

1152
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,839
um a bit on uh how to not so much get

1153
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,760
famous but how to ensure that your work

1154
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:07,559
is

1155
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,160
recognized well that that we're almost

1156
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,480
finished because now we're we're down to

1157
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:15,079
this last item which is U how to

1158
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,680
stop and when we come to that there's a

1159
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,040
question of all right well what is the

1160
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,040
final

1161
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:26,160
slide and what are the final words

1162
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,920
so for the final slide let me give you

1163
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,920
some examples of

1164
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,160
possibilities how about this

1165
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:47,400
one well you might see that

1166
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,400
slide and

1167
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,680
uh think to yourself there are thousand

1168
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,680
faculty at

1169
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,760
MIT nice piece of work but not so much

1170
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,920
but it's only a tiny any piece of work

1171
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,920
if you divide by a

1172
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,880
thousand so when you show a whole

1173
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,960
gigantic list of collaborators at the

1174
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,760
end of a talk it's a kind of it's a it's

1175
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,799
it's it's a kind of let down because it

1176
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,160
suggests that nobody knows well did you

1177
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:13,119
do anything

1178
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,240
significant now you got to you got to

1179
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,680
recognize your collaborators right so

1180
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,559
where do you do that not on the last

1181
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,119
slide on the first slide all this was on

1182
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,799
the first slide these are the

1183
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:25,079
collaborators so you don't want to put

1184
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:28,079
them at the end you don't want a slide

1185
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,880
like this

1186
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,400
how about this

1187
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,760
one this is the worst possible way to

1188
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,319
end a

1189
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,559
talk because this slide can be up there

1190
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:44,720
for 20 minutes I've seen it happen it

1191
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:47,359
squanders real estate it squanders an

1192
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,920
opportunity to tell people who you are

1193
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,920
it's it's

1194
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,240
just what about this one

1195
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,240
I often see it I've never seen anybody

1196
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,920
write it

1197
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,920
down also it wastes

1198
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,720
opportunity oh my

1199
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:13,000
[Music]

1200
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,000
God even

1201
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:20,640
worse all of these slides do nothing for

1202
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,960
you they waste an opportunity for you to

1203
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,160
tell people to leave people with what

1204
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,319
you with who you

1205
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,319
are well well what about

1206
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:34,000
this this a good

1207
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:36,280
one it might seem so at first but here's

1208
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,280
the

1209
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,720
problem if you say these are my

1210
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,799
conclusions these are perfectly

1211
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,200
legitimate conclusions that nobody cares

1212
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:48,480
about what they care about is what you

1213
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,440
have done and that's why your final

1214
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,280
slide should have this

1215
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,200
label

1216
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,880
contributions it's a mirror of what I

1217
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,000
said over there about how job talks on

1218
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,760
to ought to be like a sandwich and the

1219
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,240
final Slide the one that's up there

1220
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,680
while people are asking questions and

1221
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,280
filing out it ought to be the one that

1222
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:08,240
has your contributions on

1223
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:11,520
it here's an example from my own stump

1224
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,880
speech yeah this is what uh I talk about

1225
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,799
a lot yes here are the things that I

1226
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,799
typically

1227
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,559
demonstrate and I wait for people to

1228
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,680
read it and then the final element there

1229
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:31,720
is this is what we get out of

1230
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,400
it so that's a example of a contribution

1231
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,640
line all right

1232
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,640
now what about the other part you know

1233
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,640
you got your final slide slide up there

1234
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,359
it's a contribution slide somehow you

1235
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:48,400
have to tell people you're

1236
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,400
finished so uh let's check out a few

1237
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:55,440
possibilities one thing you could

1238
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,240
do in the final words is you could uh

1239
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,240
tell a joke

1240
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,799
it's

1241
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,240
okay by the time you're done people have

1242
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:08,440
adjusted themselves to your voice

1243
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,440
parameters they're ready for a

1244
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,799
joke I was sitting in another bar this

1245
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,880
time in Austin Texas with a colleague of

1246
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:20,599
mine named Doug lenat and Doug's a

1247
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,160
fantastic speaker and so I said uh to

1248
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:27,240
Doug Doug you're a fantastic speaker

1249
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:29,640
what's your secret and he said oh

1250
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,079
I always uh finish with a joke and that

1251
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,319
way people think they've had fun the

1252
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,319
whole

1253
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:42,240
time so yeah a joke will work down

1254
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,240
there how about uh this

1255
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:56,319
one thank

1256
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:59,599
you I don't recommend it

1257
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:01,240
it's a weak move you will not go to hell

1258
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,799
if you conclude your talk by saying

1259
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,680
thank you but it's a weak move and

1260
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,960
here's

1261
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,119
why when you say thank you even worse

1262
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,480
thank you for listening it suggests that

1263
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,920
everybody has stayed that long out of

1264
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,839
politeness and that they had a profound

1265
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,520
desire to be somewhere else but they're

1266
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,319
so polite they stuck it out and that's

1267
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,920
what you're thanking them

1268
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:24,000
for so once wild Applause has started

1269
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,599
you can mouth a thank you and it's not

1270
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,880
there's nothing wrong with that but the

1271
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,000
last thing you do do should not be

1272
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,280
saying thank

1273
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,839
you now do you say to me well doesn't

1274
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,000
everybody say thank you well what

1275
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,760
everybody does is not necessarily the

1276
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,039
right

1277
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,319
thing and I'd like to illustrate how

1278
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,079
some talks can end without saying thank

1279
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:46,039
you I like to draw from political

1280
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,160
speeches but the ones that I've heard

1281
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:49,160
recently aren't so good

1282
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,599
so

1283
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,039
so I'm going to have to go go back a

1284
00:58:53,599 --> 00:59:01,400
little bit so here's a Governor Christie

1285
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:04,480
he uh gave the U Republican keynote

1286
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,559
address one year uh this is the end of

1287
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,559

1288
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:15,480

Bless

1296
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,280
America now I I don't want to be

1297
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,440
partisan about this so I think I better

1298
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,039
switch to the keynote address in the Dem

1299
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,599
Democratic

1300
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,359
Convention I was delivered that year by

1301
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,839
by Bill Clinton who knows something

1302
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,839
about how to

1303
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,440
speak if that is what you want if that

1304
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:57,079
is what you believe you must vote and

1305
00:59:52,440 --> 01:00:00,720
you must reelect President Barack Obama

1306
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:00,720
God bless you and God bless

1307
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,839
America now watch this let's go back a

1308
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,520
little bit and redo it what I want you

1309
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,920
to see is that at one point he seems to

1310
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,319
be almost pressing his lips together

1311
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,480
forcing himself not to say thank you and

1312
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,480
then there's another place where he does

1313
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,640
a little salute so watch for those this

1314
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,280
time

1315
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:31,480
around if that that is what you want if

1316
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:35,319
that is what you believe you must vote

1317
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:38,880
and you must reelect President Barack

1318
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:42,240
Obama God bless you and God bless

1319
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:45,599
America everybody's pursing his

1320
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,599
lips there's a

1321
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,240
[Applause]

1322
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,160
SL yeah I think that's pretty good now

1323
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,079
what are we going to take away from this

1324
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,119
well um I suppose I can conclude this

1325
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,319
talked by saying uh God bless you and

1326
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:03,280
God

1327
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:05,400
bless Institute of Technology but uh it

1328
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,520
might not work so well but what what you

1329
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,599
can't get out of this is you don't have

1330
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,799
to say thank you there are other things

1331
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,960
you can do and you know it's interesting

1332
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,720
that uh over time people figure this out

1333
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,760
and there's some stock ways of ending

1334
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,000
things so uh in the Catholic church in a

1335
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
good old Latin

1336
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,599
Mass it landed with it

1337
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:30,559
Miss EST

1338
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:33,400
which translates approximately to okay

1339
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,520
the mass is over you can go home

1340
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:39,400
now and of course uh at the musical

1341
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:42,400
concerts uh you know that uh it's time

1342
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,640
to clap not at the end of the song but

1343
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,160
rather when the uh conductor goes over

1344
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,079
and shakes hands with the concert Master

1345
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:52,400
those are conventions that tell you that

1346
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:56,279
the that the event is

1347
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,799
over so uh

1348
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,559
those are all possibilities for here but

1349
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,760
one more possibility and that is that

1350
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,760
you

1351
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:11,039
can salute the audience and by that I

1352
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:13,200
mean you can say something about how how

1353
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:18,119
much you value your time and a place so

1354
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:21,279
I could say well it's been a a great fun

1355
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:23,160
being here uh it's been uh fascinating

1356
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:27,279
to see what you folks are doing here at

1357
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,640
MIT I've been uh what stimulated uh and

1358
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:31,039
and provoked by the kinds of questions

1359
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,400
you been ask has been really great and

1360
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,400
and and I look forward to coming back on

1361
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,279
many occasions in the future so that

1362
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,279
salutes the audience you can do

1363
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:47,319
that well there it is um you know what

1364
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,760
uh I'm glad you're here and and the

1365
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:52,200
reason is by being here I think you have

1366
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,200
demonstrated an understanding that how

1367
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,400
you present and how you package your

1368
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,960
ideas is an important thing

1369
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,480
and I salute you for

1370
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:06,340
that and uh I uh suggest that you uh

1371
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:28,669
come back again and bring your friends

1372
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:28,669
[Applause]
